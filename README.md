## Background

The Order Of The Phoenix from the Harry Potter Book Series was a secret society founded by Albus Dumbledore to oppose Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters. The original Order was created in the 1970s. ... The Order disbanded but was reconvened in 1995 after Harry Potter informed Dumbledore of Lord Voldemort's return.

We will be searching the Harry Potter API by Hogwarts house (e.g Griffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw or Slytherin) in order to retrieve a list of the Order of the Phoenix members that belong to that Hogwarts house.
